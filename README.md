# baddeleyGrammaticalJs
Baddeley's grammatical reasoning test implemented in jsPsych

There are 32 trials made up of the 32 possible sentences

The implemented test does not save any data right now. You must add the code to save data dependent on the platform it is being used on (cognition.run, pavlovia, etc). There is no stimuli folder for this test as all the trials are text-based and are thus no images are required.

This test currently has a 90 second time limit, you may wish to change this.
